GPIO
    GPIOC 
        Pins Used: 0-6, 8-13 (HUB75)
        Cannot use free pins in "output" mode (value will be overridden)

Timers
    TIM 3 
        PRE = 0; (HUB75)
        ARR = 0xff; (HUB75)
        Channel 1 (CC1) used (HUB75)

DMA
    DMA1_CHANNEL4 (HUB75)

SRAM
    HUB75
        (#Columns + #ExtraColumns) * (#Rows / #RowsPerCycle) * #BytesPerPixel
        (64 + 3) * (32 / 2)  * 2  = 2144 bytes

Possible further needed
    Game tick:
        Timer to trigger game tick.
    WS2812B lights: 
        1 GPIO line
        Timer for PWM/DMA refresh (at least).
        DMA
    Keypad (maybe in game tick.):
        8 GPIO lines
        Timer for refreshing (could probably use other channel of TIM3).
        DMA?
    Score Sensors (maybe in game tick):
        GPIO lines
        Timer for refresh (could probably use other channel of TIM3)
        DMA?
        SPI? (use Serial to Parallel shift register)
    Audio
        Timer
        ADC
        DMA
        SRAM
            (SampleRate / MinFrequency) * #BytesPerSample
            (48000 / 20) * 2 = 4800
